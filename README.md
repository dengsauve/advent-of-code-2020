My solutions in Ruby to AoC 2020

**Day-01**
Easy peasy, brute forcing array of ints to find some combos. Might try to refactor into a recursive function.

**Day-02**
Easy, a little ruby-fu with the password strings and boom, done.

**Day-03**
First read through seemed harder than it was, second read through realized you're only counting trees at whole integer locations.

**Day-04**
Little longer due to the amount of validation, but I got both parts right on the first try, which felt great!

**Day-05**
I messed up by not adding the column and instead ended up multiplying all three at first. Took me 15 minutes of debugging to realize my mistake, and by then any chance of top 100 was long gone. Still took me less than 30 minutes even with the hair pulling 15 of figuring out why something was amiss.
